VEHICLE RENTAL SYSTEM

The Vehicle Rental System is a Java-based project that demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to manage a vehicle rental service. The system allows users to browse available vehicles, book rentals, and manage returns efficiently while ensuring data consistency.

Features:
1)User Management: Add and manage customer details.
2)Vehicle Management: Add, remove, and view available vehicles.
3)Rental Booking: Rent vehicles and calculate rental cost based on duration.
4)Return Handling: Manage returns and update availability status.

Object-Oriented Design: Implements core OOP concepts – classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

Technologies Used:
Java (Core)
OOP Concepts (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction)

How It Works:
1)Admin/Manager adds vehicles to the system.
2)Users can request vehicle rentals.
3)System processes booking, calculates charges, and updates availability.
4)On return, the system updates the vehicle’s status.

Future Enhancements:
Integration with Database for persistent storage.
User-friendly GUI or Web Interface.
Online payment system.
